# Simple WordPress Theme for Oxygen Builder 

-Step 1. Download files.

-Step 2. Replace screenshot image (using the same name) at 1200Ã—900 Pixels.

-Step 3. Update CSS file comment code to change theme details.

-Step 4. Put all 3 files in a folder that is named with your theme slug. 

-Step 5. Zip the folder. 

Now you can upload your own custom theme. 

Note: 
You can also add a functions.php file, but I never do because we put our custom PHP in a plugin.
